### Processing NMR data obtained in NMR-MOUSE.
NMR-Mouse is an sigle-sided NMR equipment of 1.3T with constant field gradient wich let you make diffusion measurements. It is made by Magritek.
In this repository you will find codes for processing 2D measurements T~1~-D (SR-SSE) and D-T~2~ (SSE-CPMG) with Inverse Laplace Transform.
You will also find and ongoing work with diffusion distributions.
